I\'ll be going over 10 different micro SaaS examples. You\'re looking for inspiration, you want to see the competition that's out there, but it's hard to find these micro saas products. That's where I have you covered.

For each of these products, we'll be taking a look at what they do, who they were founded by and their estimated revenue. You can really see what's out there.

{{< table_of_contents >}}

#### Micro SaaS #1: Moodistory

Let's dive into our first microsass example here is called [moodistory](https://moodistory.com/).

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/2.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

It was founded by Chris and it exists to make mood tracking an easy and comfortable as well as rewarding task. It's a self care tool that brings order into your world. It's doing around a self reported thousand dollars a month in recurring revenue and it's a low effort mood tracker that takes just 5 seconds to analyze your mood, create PDF's and have different color themes and mood scales.

It receives some really good awards here, such as best of 2023 from Google Play and app of the Day on the iOS App Store. So this would definitely be a B2C microsass. And it was founded by a solo founder here and provides a lot of cool features and it's available in quite a few different languages, 25,000 active users and over 2400+ ratings.

So the founder has been creating mobile apps since 2012. From idea to finding, concept design, development, testing and marketing. It's the result of a multinational team working together to deliver an exceptional product that gives you the opportunity to get closer to yourself and improve your well being.

#### Micro SaaS #2: Product AI

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/3.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

This next microsass is going to be called [Product AI](https://www.productai.photo/) and it allows you to create AI product photos in just under 1 minute. They are a b, two b focused microsass that recently hit the one k a month in recurring revenue milestone. And overall, it's going to save companies thousands of dollars by generating these photos with AI.

We can see some examples here, from furniture to cosmetics, beverages and accessories. And it's the fastest way, as well as the easiest way to get professional commercial photos. All you have to do is upload your existing product picture, pick from a library of ready made templates, then you can simply download your favorites.

If you think about how much time this is going to save, typically as a business, you'd have to go maybe rent a studio, hire a professional photographer, hire someone to stage everything, go and take those photos, and then you have to go and do all the editing after that. And that's going to take time and way more money. Whereas here you can have these generated by AI.

And if I'm looking at them here. They look really good. And so companies would be recognizing huge cost savings as well as time savings by using a product like this.

#### Micro SaaS #3: Airloupe

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/4.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

The next Microsoft SAS we're taking a look at is called [Airloupe](https://airloupe.com/) and it makes it really easy for you to share your photos and videos with your clients quickly and profitably. They do a self reported $500 a month in revenue and they now have over 1000 creators using the product. So allows for things such as swipe, tap, zooming and impressing, simple one click downloads, and you can view your photos and videos all in one place.

If we view an example here, we can see it's a very cleanly designed product and it makes it very easy to use the exact features described. They go with a Freeman model here, starting with a free plan and it's going to move up in price as you start to add in more features, more photos and more videos. So typical SaaS model here for monetizing its users.

Airloupe was also founded by George Henderson.

#### Micro SaaS #4: Hitab 

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/5.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

This next product is called [Hitab](https://hitab.me/) and they were doing a reported $1,000 a month in revenue. It allows you to beautify your new tab with iOS widgets while offering chat GPU so little widgets big horizon.

You can create your own personalized homepage because a variety of widgets can be added and new gameplay waiting can be unlocked. You can either add it to Chrome, Edge or your webpage and the founder got this idea because they heard from many friends, including themselves, that the browser homepages don't effectively support their work and studies. So they came up with an idea to create a helpful and efficiency boosting new tab page.

You can rearrange the widgets as you like as well, to give you a ton of customizability. So the pricing on the BTC side as well, starting at $4 a month, going up to $20 a month, which makes sense as well as they're submitting chat GPT requests or GPT API requests, which can cost money for the developer.

#### Micro SaaS #5: Mango Mail

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/6.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

This next microsass is called [Mango Mail](https://mymangomail.com/).

It's doing a reported $1,000 a month in revenue. It was founded by Sean and his brother Steve, and Mango Mail exists to offer an affordable, user friendly and aesthetically pleasant pleasing email hosting solution for businesses. So you get unlimited domains, unlimited users, all at $1.50 a month. And so you're going to be paying for the data you use, not the number of mailboxes. So with this product here, it looks like they've really tried to change the angle on pricing as a main differentiator for them, as well as making a super clean UI that's easy to use for the entire team.

And like all great email tools, they make it super easy to migrate from your existing solutions to using mango Mail, and it's listed as a really solid alternative to Google Workspace.

#### Micro SaaS #6: Sheetmonkey 

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/7.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

[Sheetmonkey](https://sheetmonkey.io/) will be the next microsass we take a look at. It's doing around $750 a month in reported revenue and it allows you to submit any form to Google Sheets and it connects forms on any platform to Google sheets.

It's simple, reliable and only takes a second to set up without any backend required. They've seen some good growth as well. From December in 2020 they went from 200 users and they update on December 6 of 2023 they're now at 10,000 users.

It was founded by Levi and they wanted a simple way to connect their website audience and get details without having to build a host and a backend. And that's where Sheetmonkey came into play. They integrate with tons of different platforms from Webflow, WordPress to Squarespace, and they have quite a few features such as email notification, file uploads, as well as special fields priced on closer to the B2C side.

I would say as the starter plans cost $2.5 per month, they do go up to $20 per month for the team unlimited plan.

#### Micro SaaS #7: Vepaar

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/8.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

[Vepaar](https://vepaar.com/) is a microsass that's doing a reported $8,000 a month and it's an all in one solution for managing your online business, whether you're a grocery books, property listing or more. If you want to use WhatsApp to sell, this is a ultimate tool for you is you can use WhatsApp as a CRM to expand your business, allowing your business to reap the benefits of the most commonly used messaging app in the world, or at least one of the most commonly used.

They give you features such as a customer profile, sales funnels, ticket and activity management, as well as auto saving different chats. It also has some cool features such as having a WhatsApp poll so you can gather reliable data through WhatsApp and overall it has some great reviews. We can see one from a customer saying they gained a great number of customers in the past five months and it's all thanks to Vepaar.

In terms of their pricing, it's catered to more of a B2B  audience, which makes sense as customers of this tool would probably want to be communicating with their own customers so they can be charging on a per user basis, which could be pretty good for products too, because you're not getting taken advantage of by larger teams and they'll be paying appropriately to how many users they have.

#### Micro SaaS #8: Advanced Woo Labels

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/9.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Next, we have [Advanced Woo Labels](https://advanced-woo-labels.com/). It's product labels for woocommerce.

It was founded by Michael B. And plugins give advanced functionality for displaying and customizing woocommerce product labels. They're powering over 10,000 websites and they're doing a self reported $1,200 a month in recurring revenue.

So it gives you labels everywhere on your Woocommerce store. If you haven't used woocommerce before, it's similar to Shopify, letting you set up a online storefront and so you can add labels to your products, to the images or below it to give it different tags such as 15% off or top rated. Taking a look through some of the reports, this founder is growing by content creation.

They're focusing on new blog posts and how to articles to generate traffic for their plugin extension. Microsaas products can be great ones to start as well as you already have a predefined form of distribution. If you're listed on the plugin store, on WordPress, or if you're building a Shopify app or a squarespace app, this is going to make things a lot easier.

Although you're tied to the platform in terms of maybe you get banned or something like that, or you have negative reviews for that platform, it is great for getting marketing at the beginning and as you continue to grow as that can be. One of the hardest parts of building a microsass is trying to get people to actually find and use your product.

#### Micro SaaS #9: Lazy work

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/10.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

[Lazy work](https://www.lazywork.xyz/) is a microsass doing an estimated $2,900 in revenue and it allows you to be active from your computer without being at your computer. It's the ultimate solution for effortless break and maximum efficiency, so it's undetectable by different time tracking softwares. It has mouse, keyboard and scroll interactions as well as easy customization.

There's been a strong trend from remote work as well as employees have a hard time just sitting at your desk. You're probably going to be unproductive if you feel like you need a quick break.

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/11.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

We've seen reviews here from Robert as an example and help them stay online while they had appointments or they want to take breaks when they want to get some fresh air to help recharge them.

So definitely a cool product, which I never would have imagined five to ten years ago. As you had way fewer people working online, they've been featured in sites such as CNBC, and they're pricing for more of a B2C plan here, which makes sense as they're dealing with individual employees. So it starts at $6.65 a month, but it does go up to $49.99 a month. You can get custom features on top of that.

#### Micro SaaS #10: Auto Swiper

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10-micro-saas-examples-that-will-surprise-you/12.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Our last microsass example would definitely be in the B2B space.

It does a self reported $5,700 a month in revenue, and it was founded by Andreas Reinhold. 

It's a [Auto Swiper](https://auto-swiper.ch/) for different dating app platforms such as Tinder, Bumble, baidu, Loveo, Zoosk, POF, and OkCupid.

So you can spend less time swiping and more time dating, and that's going to help people get more matches. So it gives you quite a few options here, from age filtering to preferred words to times between swipes, as well as unwanted words, location spoofing, and quite a few different features. We're going to go with the freemium model to get people interested in to try things out, starting at 100 swipes per run and 500 per day.

And as you go up in the plans, it's going to make sense. You're going to get more features as well as more swipes. This started off as more of just a passion project to see and learn something new, but in December.

They reported 15 million swipes in October, and they have over 8000 users now. The product is definitely starting to grow. I find dating products a little interesting because the goal of it is to get you more dates, which eventually will lead you to uninstalling the app or not paying for the service.

So I'm curious to how their churn is, and maybe if they've experimented with different pricing models as if your product works really well, you can have people uninstalling faster. I mean, the same would apply to the dating apps themselves. So I'm curious what they do to maybe work with that or to try to keep users on longer.
