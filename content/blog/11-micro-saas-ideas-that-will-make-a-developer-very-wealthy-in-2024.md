Micro software as a service businesses are great ones to run. 

They have high profit margins, recurring revenue, and they can even be run by just a solo founder.

But to build a microsass, you're going to first need a good idea.

Let's go over 11 microsass ideas you can start this weekend. 

{{< table_of_contents >}}

#### Idea 1: Personal Finance Goal Tracker

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/2.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

So let's start off with our first idea, and it's going to be a little bit generic and you've probably heard it before, but, but I think there is an opportunity here because Mint just recently shut down in the last year, which is extremely popular finance tracking app.

They had millions of users, but their parent company, Intuit has quite a few different products to run and mint just wasn't making enough money for them to justify running it. I think this also coincides with a lot of people trying to save more money now, especially with inflation and things getting much more expensive. And so this tool would be one that helps users set track and achieve personal finance goals, such as saving for a vacation or paying off debt.

They should also have integrations with tools such as Plaid, which lets you integrate into different banking platforms so you can import that information. You could also do what many finance apps do, and that's to have affiliate deals for different bank accounts or credit cards that customers could open up. And key features for this would be goal setting, progress tracking, financial tips and budget integration.

And you could copy the Mint template as well by using a mobile app. Or maybe you could start up with a web app if you would find that easier. This way you don't have to develop for both iOS and Android. You could also just pick one of those platforms to start. 

#### Idea 2: Remote Interview Prep Coach

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/3.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Next idea is going to be remote interview prep coaching. It's going to be a platform that helps job seekers prepare for remote interviews with practice questions, tips and mock interview sessions.

You could also go the AI route here and analyze a person's video session, maybe analyzing things such as body behavior, an omen odd detector, as well as clarity of speech. And this could be really helpful in improving someone's speaking skills. You could also integrate different question sets from popular companies that people are interviewing at and this would make their preparation really strong prior to an interview.

Key features would be practice questions, interview tips, mock interviews and performance feedback. And you could also niche us down to maybe a specific industry. Maybe you're focusing on software engineers as their pay is also quite high, so they could really justify spending the extra money to make sure they're getting a good job with a good salary.

#### Idea 3: Online Auction Watcher

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/4.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Next, microsass would be a little bit of a smaller one, but it's going to be an online auction watcher. It'd be a tool that tracks online auctions and notifies users of changes in bid status, upcoming auctions, and winning bids. I think a way to position this as well would be to focus on higher level bids and you're going to aggregate more data.

Let's say you're focusing on cars as people are spending a good amount of money here, and they're probably looking for different auction tracking, bid notifications, a calendar and historical data to help them make an informed decision on the best price to pay for that car. 
Another niche for this could be trading cards. 
As trading cards can trade and sell for a lot of money, so there's a high incentive for people to get a really good price on them.

#### Idea 4: Pet Care Reminder

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/5.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Our next idea is going to be pet care reminders, and it's going to be an app that's going to send reminders for pet care tasks such as feeding, grooming and veterinarian appointments. 
Key features could be customizable reminders, pet profiles, health tracking and activity logs. 

I think an approach to this could be creating a free application, then having affiliate deals with different pet food companies or anything that's gonna sell pet products.

#### Idea 5: Remote Team Building Activity Generator

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/6.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Next idea is to help remote teams bond and build connections together. And it's gonna be a building activity generator. It's a tool that's gonna generate and schedule team building activities.

You could focus specifically on remote teams. You could also do in person to foster engagement and collaboration. Key features for this would be activity suggestions, scheduling, team feedback and participation tracking.

Getting to know your colleagues as a remote employee can be extremely difficult as you're not gonna have that one on one FaceTime or just casual conversations that you would have in person. So really making sure that you're fostering that sense of team and working together is extremely important. And a tool like this can really help with it.

It could be something like a slack box integration. 
So you're gonna integrate with a company's existing tools and you have all the company profiles there, making it really easy to set up these group activities. 
It could also have features such as voting on a specific activity, and it could be a specific person or team lead charged with this, and they're organizing everyone together.

#### Idea 6: Freelance Project Scope Estimator

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/7.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

This is going to be a product specifically designed to help freelancers estimate project scope time and cost based on project details and industry standards. Key features for this would be a scope definition, time estimation, cost calculations and a proposal generation. This would be an interface that could help freelancers save quite a bit of time when setting up the initial part of the project.

This can also prevent you from having to do a bunch of one on one calls, which can take quite a bit of time. Doing a asynchronous approach such as this would make things much easier.

#### Idea 7: Virtual Plant Care Assistant

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/8.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Next up is going to be a very niche SAS product, but it could be a virtual plant care assistant. And it's going to be an app that provides personalized care instructions and reminders for indoor plants based on plant type and environment. So key features for this would be plant identification, care schedules, watering reminders and health monitoring.

How you can see this setup is that the user simply takes a photo of the plant, it's gonna identify it and then give them all the instructions with push reminders on their phone to make sure they're keeping that plant in a healthy state. You could also have progress updates where you're taking photos of the plant. They can identify things such as you water too much, you're watering it not enough, it should be growing at this rate.

I think there's a lot of different things that can aid people in taking care of plants, especially for beginners.

#### Idea 8: Language Exchange Partner Matcher

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/9.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Our next idea is gonna be a language exchange partner matcher and it's gonna be a platform that connects language learners with native speakers for mutual language practice and exchange. There are tons of different apps that help you learn different languages.

I hear so much that it's way different when you go to that country specifically and you're talking to a native speaker. So an app like this can make very efficient to actually put your language learning to the test. And key features for this would be user matching, chat and video call features, language practice tools, and progress tracking.

You can kind of gamify this approach a little bit to help keep users engaged and coming back for more conversations with native speakers.

#### Idea 9: AI-Based Mood Tracker

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/10.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Our next idea is going to be an AI based mood tracker and it's going to be an app that uses AI to analyze users daily moods based on their inputs and provide insights and recommendations for improving mental well being. AI is quite good at getting sentiment analysis from text, so you can even do a free form approach where a person is journaling and I think it'd be really cool to get overall insights such as you were doing your best on these days when you did this activity, something that would take quite a bit of time to manually filter through but can be done quite easily using artificial intelligence.

Key features for this would be mood logging, AI analysis, personalized recommendation, as well as progress tracking, just making sure they're inputting everything every day and tracking where their mood is good or not so great.

#### Idea 10: Remote Work Time Zone Coordinator

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/11.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Next idea is going to be a remote work time zone coordinator and it's going to be a tool that helps remote teams coordinate across different time zones, scheduling meetings and managing work hours. So rather than having to manually go to a time zone converter, this would make life much easier.

It could be something like a slack bot integration that's going to do all this time zone conversion for you, meeting scheduling, work hour tracking and notifications to make sure you're getting to those meetings on time.

#### Idea 11: Personalized Fitness Challenge Creator

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/10_micro_saa_s_ideas_that_will_make_a_developer_very_wealthy_in_2024/12.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

For our last idea, it's going to be a personalized fitness challenge creator and it's going to be an app that allows users to create and participate in personalized fitness challenges, tracking progress and competing with friends.

I think a strong social feature in this could help increase engagement and key features could be challenge creation, progress tracking, social sharing, as well as motivational. This could also be niche down to a specific sport. Maybe you're focusing on something such as pickleball, which has grown quite rapidly in popularity and it's going to create customized workouts for you to get better.

At pickleball, maybe you're niching down even further and you're focusing on people over 60 who want to play Pickleball. This is the ultimate app for you to help improve your performance in your age demographic.
