## Example #1. Bank Statement Converter

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/2.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Let's take a look at our first micro saas here. It's called [Bank Statement Converter.](https://bankstatementconverter.com/)

It was founded by Angus Chen. This product allows you to convert PDF statements into CSV files. This product came about from a simple need, the need to convert your PDF's to a CSV so you can actually use that data.

As many banks don't provide this as an option, they only let you export a CSV. But if you're trying to do anything around taxes or to look through your statements and transactions, it's so much harder to do with a PDF. So this lets you easily convert these statements from thousands of banks worldwide into a clean XLS or CSV format.

They built this to be very secure. They provided this service to thousands of reputable financial, accounting and legal firms, and they're continuing to improve their algorithm to be super accurate. It also does a self reported $18,000 a month in recurring revenue, so it's doing quite well.

The SaaS also has no employees and is just run by one founder, so they generate revenue on a monthly basis using reoccurring subscriptions depending on the number of pages, and it goes from $30 to $99 a month. 

## Example #2. Glorify

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/3.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Our second micro saas tool does a self reported $14,000 a month and it's called [Glorify](https://glorify.com/). So it's a graphic design tool for e commerce and it was founded by Omar Faruk and so it was built as an in between as Adobe is way too complex and canva is too basic.

Their big goal was to bring professional designers and non designers into one tool when they can collaborate and work with zero limits to design beautiful content. And it's going to really speed up this process is you can create all your ecommerce ads, banners and posts in just 6 seconds. And it's a tool that's been used by over 300,000 entrepreneurs and marketers, and they've done some for merchants on all platforms from Shopify, Amazon, Etsy and more.

They also have AI powered features to speed up this process. Let you have some really cool features here, such as creating and adjusting at scale with batch editing for your images. In terms of how they generate revenue, it's gonna be on a monthly basis like most micro saas products, starting from $8 per month and moving up to $45 per month on the business plan.

## Example #3. Scraping Ant

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/4.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Our next micro saas is called [Scraping Ant](https://scrapingant.com/). It does a self reported $13,000 a month and has two co founders in OLG and Mega. They wanted to start a business instead of doing full time office jobs, so they brought their experiences as programmers to build something they were passionate about.

They have ten plus years in software development startups R&D, and they use that to build this micro saas. And it's web scraping without getting blocked. And they're going to handle headless browsers and rotating proxy servers for you with no credit card required when you want to sign up.

They have 3 million plus proxy servers across the world. You can do things such as having unlimited parallel requests in terms of how they're going to generate revenue. It's going to be on a credit basis for monthly plans going from $19 to $249. And this is definitely a really big space. In previous post, we've looked at other SaaS companies that do headless browser management and they've generated quite a bit of revenue. 

## Example #4. Choppity

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/5.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Next, micro sass is called [Choppity](https://choppity.com/) and lets you turn your podcasts or videos into tiktoks in just a few clicks. The vision is to automate social media video marketing. It was founded by Aaron and it does a self reported $10,000 a month. Some features of this micro saas is that it's ten times faster than using traditional video editing software.

It's 35 times cheaper, and it's very intuitive. There's even mentioned on Business Insider as one of the top six AI Tools podcasters use. So it's going to take your long form content and use AI to chop everything up into small digestible clips.

You can then share on your social media platforms. I think it's a great tool to use and it's going to repurpose what is existing long form content. And without having to film anything more, you can just create short form content very easily and they're loved by over 21,000 plus creatives.

## Example #5. Skinive

Next, Microsoft's going to cover a very different type of niche. This one's called [Skinive](https://skinive.com/) and it's meant to be an AI dermatologist and does a self reported $11,000 a month in recurring revenue. This product targets 2 billion plus people suffering from different skin conditions and provides immediate self diagnosis as well as personal skincare advice in order to improve their skin, health and beauty, as well as their quality of life.

There's two founders, Kirill and Artem. They have over 250,000 users worldwide. I think this is definitely a really cool example of how you can take technology that's in every person's phone and combining it with something that you usually need a dermatologist for. That's going to give you early scans an idea of what's going on with your skin. 

Now, this probably isn't a replacement for a real dermatologist, so this isn't any health advice about this. I'm not a doctor or a dermatologist.

We're just looking at different micro saas products. But according to the website here, they are CE-Marked medical software, trusted by dermatologists and being used by people at home and professionals in primary care all around the world. They have some cool features like 3d full body mole mapping and AI based real time cameras helping take the best photos and evaluating skin problems. It looks like they've done 1.9 million skin checks done in quite a few different things. Identified.

## Example #6. ConveyThis

Our next micro saas is called [Coverr](https://coverr.co/). It's doing a self reported $18,000 a month and it was founded by Yoav Hornung. And so this product is going to be more of a marketplace for beautiful stock free footage as it's really expensive to get high quality stock assets like this.

And so they're gonna have a free version and then the paid member only premium content version that's also gonna be an ad free experience. And the goal of this product is to create a place for people to find really high quality stock footage that's not crazy expensive, as a premium plan is even only $10 per month. 

## Example #8. Centori

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/9.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

They're doing a self reported $11,000 a month and they're going to help marketers use SEO as a growth channel for their business. So this one's going to be a combination of software and coaching and community as they're selling.

This as a combined package is you're going to get access to simple SEO software that's going to let you understand how you're doing. This is probably a stronger sell than just selling one or the other separately. So I think it's cool how they went and combined. This is if you want to get into SEO, it's probably not just enough to have a software as you need to learn how to do it as well. And so that's where things such as their monthly group coaching calls and their private community come in. 

## Example #9. Klu

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/10.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Our next product is called [Klu](https://klu.ai/). It was founded by Stefan and it started out as their internal tooling for quickly experimenting with their app and features ideas that used chat GPT-3 they learned a lot from that and they went and expanded their platform and created this tool from it.

It's going to go up in price depending on the number of responses and features you're looking for.

I think a cool feature of this product is token gating. So this is meant for web three companies by integrating token based access controls. So this unique approach ensures that forms and surveys are accessible exclusively to specified token holders, facilitating authentic, targeted and decentralized feedback. So if you are a web3 company, I think that's a really cool approach to making sure you're getting the right responses from the right people. 

## Example #11. Reply Mind

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/12.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

Our next micro saas is called [Form Wise](https://www.formwise.ai/). This was founded by Jabeye and it does $26,000 a month in self reported revenue and lets you create unlimited white label AI tools in just minutes. So you can turn popular chat GPT prompts into irresistible lead magnets, tiny offers and marketing tools without coding. So you can join 4000 plus coaches, course creators and agency creating AI tools in just minutes.

So let's let anyone without any coding knowledge go and generate tools. I think this is a cool product to have, as we've seen just about every existing product out there. Integrate AI somehow.

Maybe you have a course in Kajabi, or you have a site using WordPress and you want to integrate AI, but you're not sure how to build your own application. A tool such as form wise is going to let you do that. And we're seeing some review here, such as we built an AIPC internal tool for the team and they've made campaign planning and onboarding an absolute delight.

There's person from HL Pro Tools created a lead magnet for their clients and overall it's just going to speed up the development time and it's going to simplify and probably be much cheaper if you don't know how to code. 

## Example #13. Intend

So it's a solo founded project and it lets you be purposeful in your day and you get into flow in just ten minutes. So it's doing a self reported $11,000 a month in recurring revenue. And overall, this product came from just the founder's own experience.

They're highly interested in figuring out how people work on every level and they're super into productivity and it helped them generate enormous amounts of value. And so now they're helping others do so through their micro saas called Intend. 

## Example #14. Bug Fender

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/15.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

For our second last one, we have [Bug Fender](https://bugfender.com/). It was founded by Stefan and Jordy and it does a self reported $27,000 a month in revenue. So it's a remote logger, a crash reporter and in app user feedback it integrates with a ton of different frameworks and languages and it's going to allow you to track and destroy bugs before users even notice. So this product is definitely in the b two B space as a regular person isn't going to need crash reports or a log viewer.

And like many B2B SaaS products, they're going to have a free plan for indie developers experimental applications. And then as these applications start to grow, they're going to charge you for more logs aligned and the pricing is going to be in line with the value that your app is generating and the usage it's utilizing. 

## Example #15. Thumbnail Test

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/15-profitable-micro-saas-examples-that-will-help-you-level-up/16.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

And the founders started to see some significant growth when they got a shout out from a large YouTube channel called Think Media that talked about their tool here and they've served over 1000 plus channels. This looks like over 1.9 billion views measured. 

So this is going to conclude the video here and we looked at 15 different micro SaaS examples. I hope you enjoyed the content.
