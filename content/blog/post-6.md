#### 1.Create High-Quality Content
The first step to growing your Google AdSense revenue is to increase your blog traffic. Because the more traffic your blog gets, the more opportunities you have to get clicks.

There are a number of tactics that you can try to get more traffic to your blog, but none of them will pay off if your blog isn’t filled with valuable, high-quality content.

High-quality content is what will attract visitors to your blog. Plus, it will keep visitors on your site for longer. This helps to decrease your bounce rate, improve your SEO, and increase your search engine rankings, which will also help get you more visitors overall.

On the other hand, if you’ve been blogging for a while, you can look at the blog posts that are currently driving traffic to your site to get new content ideas.

Using the MonsterInsights plugin, you can head to the Publishers report to find out what the top landing pages on your site are.

Top posts and pages MonsterInsights
Since these top posts and pages are already driving traffic to your website, you can come up with similar topics, create new content around them, and bring even more traffic to your site thus increasing AdSense earnings!

#### 2.Use the Right Keywords
For people to discover your blog via Google or other search engines, they need to type search terms (or keywords) into the search bar.

So, if your content ranks for keywords that people are already typing into search engines, you’ll easily be able to get a boost in traffic. Which in turn, can boost your Google AdSense earnings.

But how do you find out what keywords people use to look up your website?

It’s easy with MonsterInsights. Simply go to the Search Console report to see your blog’s top Google search terms. For each search term, you can see data on the number of clicks, impressions, click-through rate (CTR), average position, and cost per click (CPC).

Alternatively, you can also use Google Analytics, especially their Keyword Tool, to find these exact metrics.

You can use these valuable insights to optimize your blog for similar keywords and discover new keywords that you can create content around.

This also helps you figure out which transactional keywords drive the most traffic to your site. 

Transactional keywords are search terms where the user is showing signs that they are ready to buy. An example of a transactional keyword would be something like ‘buy blog hosting.’

By targeting transactional keywords like this, not only can you drive traffic but also attract exactly the type of audience that wants to buy what you’re advertising. It’s one of the most powerful tips to increase AdSense revenue with minimal effort.

#### 3.Give Your Blog a User-Friendly Design
The longer a visitor stays on your website, the more Google will push you up search engine rankings and direct more traffic toward your site.

Plus, the longer visitors stay on your blog, the more trust they develop with you, which also makes them more likely to click on your ads.

That’s why it’s so important for your blog to have a user-friendly design.

First, if your WordPress theme isn’t responsive, your blog won’t look good or function properly on mobile devices. This will cause visitors to leave your blog in search of a competitor website that’s more mobile-friendly.

And according to internet usage statistics, over 90% of the global internet population uses a mobile device to go online. So, that’s a lot of clicks you could be missing out on.
