And by treating the partners right, the software companies are going to grow even faster as it's going to make things easier for their affiliates. It's going to give you features such as a dashboard, the marketplace, which is an affiliate program hub for B2B SaaS companies, showcasing your program to over 6000 SaaS affiliates.
