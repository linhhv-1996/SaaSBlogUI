Our first micro saas product is going to be called [InAppStory](https://inappstory.com/). It does around $7,000 in monthly revenue. It's going to be a b two b focused micro saas that's going to allow for full screen stories in your mobile app so you can extend the lifecycle of your mobile customers across the journey.

It has a self reported revenue of around $1,000 a month and earlier this year they had a reported 3600 users.

So as mentioned, it's an all in one browser, tab and tab group manager we can see here. They've also added it to chrome Edge and Brave, giving them more platforms for their customers to use the tool. So overall a cool micro saas product that definitely serves a need and it gives you some features that aren't there normally, such as restoring tabs in a new window, creating different groups, suspending tabs and having different keyboard shortcuts.

For this micro saas, they actually went with more of a freemium model here cause there is a free plan with no signup needed. Other than that it's $2.49 a month or $50 for a lifetime offer.

Those are really more for those advanced features here. And that makes sense given they've had around 3600 users and a few hundred paying customers. 

#### #3. MailRush: Powerful tool for optimizing and automating campaigns

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/4.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

The next micro saas we're looking at is a little bit of a larger one, doing around $22,000 a month in revenue.

It's called [MailRush](https://mailrush.io/) and it's a tool that lets you send cold emails and follow ups with no effort. It's an automation tool built for the B two b space and does other features such as email warm up, email validation and email follow ups. So if you to think about doing this process manually, it's very time consuming as you have to keep track of everything. Send out those emails and make sure you're following up correctly so you don't miss out on any leads. And that's where a tool such as mail rush can really come in.

Cold email is one that's hard to crack, as well as there's so many things you need to deal with with different spam filters and making sure there's enough personalization. And they also have features, features such as email warming, which is going to help improve the deliverability of your emails. They've also been working on some AI tool integration here and there's called their Spintax AI assistant that helps make crate dynamic and engaging cold email outreach a breeze.

So you're avoiding that content repetition and you can increase the chances of grabbing your recipients attention. Definitely a very cool outreach product.

And so you're gonna be paying with just dollars instead of selling your data. Privacy has become more of a big trend here. We've seen search engines such as DuckDuckGo take up quite a bit of share of search volume, and that's because people are caring about their privacy more.

So it makes sense here why there would be a tool focusing on that specific niche. 

#### #6. PriceWell: Stripe Subscriptions Without Hiring a Developer

#### #13. ProjectionLab: Simulate your financial future and chart a course toward your best life

<img width="100%" src="/images/blogs/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/14.webp" class="feat-img wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" title="">

And if we take a look at one of the examples, it can pull things such as the date, the name, the address, the phone number and the amount. And you can easily sync that in with your different accounting software.

[Projection Lab](https://projectionlab.com/) is a micro saas that does a reported $24,000 a month in revenue.

And it was founded by Kyle Nolan. And it was started because the founder had trouble finding a finance simulation tool that could actually model things in enough detail to ditch the spreadsheets. They didn't want to make you link real financial accounts, so they decided to build a tool that solved their own problem.

You can build financial plans you love, and simulate your financial future, and chart a course towards your best life. It's going to make it super easy to visualize this too, rather than just seeing numbers on a page. This makes sense too, because humans have a much better time understanding charts and graphs than they do looking at raw numbers.

And if we read the review from Brandon Ganch, Projection Lab is the most beautiful financial planning tool they've ever seen. And it's done a good job of pairing themselves with the fire movement, which I believe stands for financially independent, retire early.

It's a completely bootstrap product here. And in December, Kyle is able to leave their corporate job and go all in on their side project. So congratulations to Kyle.
