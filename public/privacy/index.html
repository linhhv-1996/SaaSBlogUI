                </h1>

                <p>Your privacy is very important to us. At Blog Tyrant we have a few fundamental principles
                    that we follow:</p>



                <p>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services
                    that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</p>



                <p>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop
                    our products, or protect our rights.</p>



                <p>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation
                    of our site.</p>



                <p>Awesome Motive Inc. (“Awesome Motive”) operates several websites including awesomemotive.com,
                    wpbeginner.com, list25.com, balkhis.com, syedbalkhi.com, isitwp.com, soliloquywp.com,
                    enviragallery.com, optinmonster.com, and blogtyrant.com. It is Awesome Motive’s policy to
                    respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
                </p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Website Visitors</h2>



                <p>Like most website operators, Awesome Motive collects non-personally-identifying information
                    of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
                    type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
                    Awesome Motive’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
                    understand how Awesome Motive’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Awesome Motive
                    may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
                    report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>



                <p>Awesome Motive also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
                    Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs.
                    Awesome Motive only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                    circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described
                    below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the
                    administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>



                <p>Certain visitors to Awesome Motive’s websites choose to interact with Awesome Motive in ways
                    that require Awesome Motive to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and
                    type of information that Awesome Motive gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
                    For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email
                    address. Those who wish to receive Blog Tyrant updates via email, we collect their emails.
                    In each case, Awesome Motive collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
                    appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Awesome Motive. Awesome
                    Motive does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
                    And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
                    that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aggregated Statistics</h2>



                <p>Awesome Motive may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For
                    instance, Awesome Motive may monitor the most popular pages on the list25.com site or use
                    spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Awesome Motive may display this
                    information publicly or provide it to others. However, Awesome Motive does not disclose
                    personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>



                <p>Awesome Motive discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                    information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that
                    (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Awesome Motive’s behalf or to
                    provide services available at Awesome Motive’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to
                    disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may
                    be located outside of your home country; by using Awesome Motive’s websites, you consent to
                    the transfer of such information to them. Awesome Motive will not rent or sell potentially
                    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
                    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Awesome Motive
                    discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in
                    response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Awesome Motive
                    believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
                    rights of Awesome Motive, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
                    of an Awesome Motive website and have supplied your email address, Awesome Motive may
                    occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or
                    just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Awesome Motive and our products. We
                    primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we
                    expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
                    support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
                    order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
                    Awesome Motive takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
                    access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information.</p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cookies</h2>



                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that
                    the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Awesome Motive
                    uses cookies to help Awesome Motive identify and track visitors, their usage of Awesome
                    Motive website, and their website access preferences. Awesome Motive visitors who do not
                    wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies
                    before using Awesome Motive’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Awesome
                    Motive’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Business Transfers</h2>



                <p>If Awesome Motive, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event
                    that Awesome Motive goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one
                    of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
                    transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Awesome Motive may continue to use your
                    personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ads</h2>



                <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who
                    may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they
                    send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your
                    computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
                    advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers
                    the use of cookies by Awesome Motive and does not cover the use of cookies by any
                    advertisers.</p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Comments</h2>



                <p>Comments and other content submitted to Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our
                    servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough
                    to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>



                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>



                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Awesome Motive may change its Privacy Policy
                    from time to time, and in Awesome Motive’s sole discretion. Awesome Motive encourages
                    visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued
                    use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of
                    such change.</p>
